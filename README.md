# kg_neil-patel28_2020

Here is my final version of my main.java program. I elected to use java for this coding assessment.

Commit #1 
For the first version of the coding assessment, I made sure that one-to-one mapping exists from string s1 to string s2. For example: s1 = foo and s2 = bar, the output would return false.

Commit #2 
For the second version of the coding assessment, I made sure that one-to-one mapping exists from string s1 to string s2 as well but also wanted to make sure that if s1 was bar and s2 was foo, then I will retuen true because bar can be mapped to a charater in foo. For example: s1 = bar and s2 = foo, the output would return true.

Commit #3
For the final version of the codding assesment, it was the same as commit #2, but without a main method because testcases were tested in the testCode branch. Here is my main.java program with test cases in the main function. I elected to use java for this coding assessment. Time complexity is O(n) because only one for loop is being used to compare each character from both strings. Space complexity is O(n) because there are n amount of variables being used.
