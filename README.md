Here is my main.java program with test cases in the main function. I elected to use java for this coding assessment.

Commit #1
For the first version of the coding assessment, I made sure that one-to-one mapping exists from string s1 to string s2.
For example: s1 = foo and s2 = bar, the output would return false.

Commit #2
For the second version of the coding assessment, I made sure that one-to-one mapping exists from string s1 to string s2 as well but also wanted to make sure that if s1 was bar and s2 was foo, then I will retuen true because bar can be mapped to a charater in foo.
For example: s1 = bar and s2 = foo, the output would return true.
